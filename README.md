# Stable-Diffusion-Pytorch

## Overview
This is an educational repository on fine-tuning publicly available Stale-Diffusion model at HuggingFace. The repository includes a custom Stable-Diffusion Model class configurable for both conditional and unconditional image training. Compared to other impressive Pytorch implementations of Stable-Diffusion, of which there are many, this repository aims to provide an easy framework to work with Stable-Diffusion model on fine-tuning tasks rather than implement from scratch, out of consideration for computational resources and redundancy. 

The curren repository is available to fine-tune on conditional or unconditional fine-tuning. For future developments, this repository will aim to expand the fine-tuning framework to Image-to-Image translation, Image inpainting, and other areas within reason. Results are, or will be, shown below along with instructions on usage and deploymnet.
